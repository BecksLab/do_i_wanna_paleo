Linking structure and function to ecological processes

## Section Overview

-   We can use the networks that we built from the previous section and showcase how they (maybe) are giving way different metrics (telling different stories)

-   I think if we have multiple networks for different time points as well we can compare within and between network differences? (need to have a think on that)
