## Why build paleo food webs?

-   Because its interesting?

-   Value in using hindcasting to aid in forecasting. *e.g.,* the Toarcian ms shows how we can use these paleo communities to understand trophic-level responses to extinctions.

## How do we do it?

-   There is an evolving body of work that focuses on developing tools specifically for the task of predicting food webs.

-   There are a handful that have been developed specifically in the context of paleo settings *e.g.,* TODO but we can also talk about those that might have been developed/tested in contemporary settings but still have applicability in paleo ones.

-   Different underlying theory though

-   Insert brief overview of the different methods as they pertain to approach (so the T4T triangle)

-   Challenges we face (even in contemporary settings)?

    -   keep high level - I think the argument here should fall more in the data tradeoffs...

## Understanding how networks are different

-   Not always representing the same things (*i.e.,* different underlying philosophies). So, although they may all be representing food webs (and feeding links between species) they are 'telling different stories' - T4T work...

    -   feasibility (*e.g.* PFIM) vs energy (*e.g.* ADBM)

        -   fundamental vs realised niche analogy??

    -   understanding what links are representing

-   Need to be careful when we are 'presenting'/analysing these different food webs and we can't really compare on contrast

-   *e.g.,* @brimacombe2023 shows that the research group influences the 'criteria' that defines interactions/networks and so we can't actually meaningfully integrate these networks into the same database and assume that they 'fit' together.

-   Petchy dilemma?

## Challenges specific to paleo communities/networks

-   I think the goal here should be more a way of acknowledging some of the limitations we face and not a 'this is a complete waste of time' narrative

-   Don't actually have both the complete community (preservation bias) or location specific occurrence (to account for preservation bias often need to aggregate from different locations???)

-   

## Section Overview

-   introduce/discuss some of the food web reconstruction methods

-   construct networks for (ideally) a datasets across distinct time units using these (or some of) approaches

-   compare and contrast if they tell us a different story
