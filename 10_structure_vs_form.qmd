Linking structure and function to ecological processes

## Section Overview

-   What do we mean by structure = a way in which we are 'summarising' the network - usually at the 'meta' (network) level but we can also look at the 'micro' (node) level..

-   But does form (structure) = function??

-   Also does the form-function link differ when thinking of bipartite/unipartite systems? I'm inclined to think that many of the ways in which we measure form has been developed in the context of bipartite systems and is there really an ecological reason that they will hold in unipartite systems?

-   Insert a table that attempts to summarise
