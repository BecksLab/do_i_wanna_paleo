The probability of a link existing between a consumer and resource (in its most basic form) is defined as follows:\n\\[\nP_{ij} = \\frac{p}{1+p}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\np = exp[\\alpha + \\beta log(\\frac{M_{i}}{M_{j}}) + \\gamma log^{2}(\\frac{M_{i}}{M_{j}})]\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe original latent-trait model developed by Rohr et al. (2010) also included an additional latent trait term \\(v_{i} \\delta f_{j}\\) however for simplicity we will use Equation 1 as per Yeakel et al. (2014). Based on Rohr et al. (2010) it is possible to estimate the parameters \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\delta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) using a GLM but we will use the parameters from Yeakel et al. (2014), which was ‘trained’ on the Serengeti food web data and are as follows: \\(\\alpha = 1.41\\), \\(\\delta = 3.75\\), and \\(\\gamma = 1.87\\).",

Particularly thinking about what we actually do with the data, how we interpret structure and function (linking the ‘summary statistics’ to ecological theory), and understanding the conceptual differences between a metaweb and a realised network (and how we downsample from one to the other).\nIn terms of turning these concepts into a tangible ‘item’ the idea is to compare and contrast some of the canonical methods used for reconstructing paleo food webs across different transitions (e.g., extinction events), see how these different methods might (or not) result in different ‘summary statistics’ and also make sure to link the ‘summary statistic’ to the relevant ecological theory (in the context of both structure and function).\nWe could even do a dashboard!! - See Andrew’s below (although it is not rendering properly, which is grating).",
