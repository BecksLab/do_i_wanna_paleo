(2022) showcases how the use of machine learning (binary classifiers) that is trained using contemporary interaction data has a better predictive accuracy than the body mass ratio model from Rohr et al. (2010). However, there is of course the caveat that there is a ‘time cap’ as to how far back in time we expect this type of approach to to be able to ‘work’. Fricke et al. (2022) focused on mammals from the Late Pleistocene which are of course (physically (trait space)/phylogenetically) well represented by current mammal species and so the assumption that we can use these present links to inform past ones has merit.

    "text": "Methods\nDigging onto the details, the niche model introduces the idea that species interactions are based on the ‘feeding niche’ of a species. Broadly, all species are randomly assigned a ‘feeding niche’ range along the resource axis, and all species that fall in the range of a species can be consumed by that species (thereby allowing for cannibalism). The niche of each species is randomly assigned and the range of each species’ niche is (in part) also constrained by the specified connectance of the network. The original model itself has undergone some modification, however it appears that adding to the ‘complexity’ of the niche model does not improve on its ability to generate a more ecologically ‘correct’ network (Williams and Martinez 2008).\n\nI guess we can plop the OG schematic of the niche model in here…\n\nAn important feature to keep in mind when it comes to the niche model is that it defines a the nodes of the network as ‘trophic species’, that is nodes are considered the ‘same’ because they have the same diet and not because they are of the same taxonomic group, one can also think of nodes to thus represent feeding guilds. Importantly this means that the niche model is ‘species agnostic’ and it is not possible to recover pairwise links between specific pairs of species as the network itself is not informed by the identity of the species but rather on the assumption that ‘trophic species’ have a position along the niche axis. Although this way of defining the networks my seem to be a gross oversimplification it does have the advantage that it does not require a lot of data upfront (only species richness and the expected connectance of a network) while (supposedly) granting us a summary of the network structure\n\nsecret aside is that the problem we have with using something like the niche model is that 1) it is not species specific and 2) we are making gross assumptions with regards to what we suspect the connectance of paleo food webs are. But maybe we are still going to get similar structural outputs - who knows…\n\nAlthough the niche model doe snot require that much data it still requires that we make the critical assumption with regards to what we think the connectance of these paleo food webs/communities will look like… Also it means it is not a metric that we can ‘track’ when is comes to looking at how the networks change across space…\nI’m going to use 0.1 for now as a place holder but we will probably have to have a think on this",

This is different to the previous examples because here it is using the expected link distribution that we might expect to find in the real world (so realised, energy constrained networks) to prune of links. I think we can argue this is somewhat stochastic, whereas the previous point is still operating within the feasibility space\n\nWhy do we want/need to downsample?\nThis is going to boil down to objectives… Something like a metaweb is useful in that it is going to give you an idea of diets/the potential prey of a species but going to be a poor representation of reality. When asking questions about ‘on the ground’ things that are happening you are going to need to be operating with networks that are closer to reality.\n\nI wonder how much this is going to link back again to how we are measuring form and function - particularly at the scale within the network (micro, meso, macro, meta)…\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDansereau, Gabriel, Ceres Barros, and Timothée Poisot. 2023. “Spatially Explicit Predictions of Food Web Structure from Regional Level Data,” September. https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/5941/.\n\n\nRoopnarine, Peter D. 2006. “Extinction Cascades and Catastrophe in Ancient Food Webs.” Paleobiology 32 (1): 1–19. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4096814.",
