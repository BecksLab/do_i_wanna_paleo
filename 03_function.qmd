moving from summary to process (reductionist to process?, measuring vs describing?)

## Stability

Traditional definition of stability: the inclination of a system (network) to return to its original function following a stress/perturbation in its biotic component(s). Using this framework as a means to assess the stability of networks (and what property might be responsible for driving stability) means we need a firm grasp of what 'function' encapsulates and also how we define a stressor. Some working definitions of stability: local stability of equilibria, persistence of species

### Stability as robustness

Understanding stability in the context of species loss - especially secondary extinctions. (which is very much a central theme in paleo ecology one would assume)

### Stability as variance
